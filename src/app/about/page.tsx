				<p>
					I'm Flavio Espinoza — a senior front-end engineer with over 11 years of experience
					building fast, accessible, and elegant interfaces using React, TypeScript, and Next.js.
				</p>

				<p>
					My work blends engineering precision with design sensibility. I have a master’s degree in
					architecture and have received multiple design awards, including first place in a global
					competition. I apply that same eye for structure, layout, and hierarchy in the interfaces
					I build.
				</p>

				<p>
					I specialize in responsive UI development, design systems, data visualization (D3.js), and
					integrating with AI/LLM APIs like OpenAI. I'm currently focused on building performant
					front-end apps with Tailwind CSS, Zustand, and React Server Components.
				</p>

				<p>
					I'm open to full-time or contract opportunities — remote preferred, or on-site in the Salt
					Lake City area. Let’s work together.
