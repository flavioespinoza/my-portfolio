        <p>
          I'm Flavio Espinoza — a senior front-end engineer with 11+ years of experience crafting
          user-facing applications with React, TypeScript, and modern UI tooling.
        </p>
        <p>
          I specialize in building responsive, accessible, and theme-aware interfaces with frameworks like
          Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Zustand. Lately, I've been exploring AI tools and LLMs to build
          intelligent user interfaces — such as GPT-powered chat systems and data visualization engines.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also have a background in architecture, having earned a master's degree and multiple design
          awards. This informs my approach to visual hierarchy, layout, and interaction patterns.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm currently open to remote roles or opportunities in Salt Lake City, Utah (or nearby).
          Let’s connect and create something meaningful.
