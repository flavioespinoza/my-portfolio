I have a React NextJS 14 project that has trouble, and the parent components are losing connection to their child appearance during asynchronous updates. One thing that stopped working is that the open model button no longer opens the model component. The page does a lot of re-renders due to asynchronous updates. I need the parents and their children to stay connected, no matter how many updates we do.

Do an in-depth analysis and explain why this code is broken. Propose solutions. Show fully completed revised code for all files that need to be changed, if any. Review the attached file: Source A - Directory Structure and Files.pdf. It shows the directory structure and code files. Analyze React 18 documentation. Refer to the attached files: Source B - Forwarding Refs – React.pdf and Source C - Hooks API Reference – React.pdf.

Also, make sure that it follows React's current best practices and that the TypeScript
adheres to current standards. Refer to the attached files: Source D - Rules of React – React.pdf and Source E - TypeScript - Rules.pdf
