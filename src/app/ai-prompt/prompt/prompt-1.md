Your task is to identify and resolve a specific, verifiable bug in this Next.js + React 18 TypeScript project. Thoroughly work through each step:

**Analysis**
Thoroughly analyze the codebase provided in Source A, and to identify potential bugs, including logical errors, unhandled edge cases, or deviations from documented behavior. Focus on prioritizing bugs with clear failure cases that can be verified. Review Source B, Source C, and Source D before you start your analysis and produce your report.

**Report**
Produce a brief report on your findings that includes the following:
- A brief description of the issue and how it affects other parts of the code.
- Identify the file(s) and line number(s) where the issue is.
- Propose solution strategies and tradeoffs.
- Cite from the Sources provided in your analysis to support your solution.

**Solution**
- IMPORTANT: Your solution must ensure that any existing code logic or styling is preserved.
- IMPORTANT: The fix must be reproducible and verifiable through testing.
- IMPORTANT: Provide fully refactored code for all files that are changed.
- DO NOT provide code snippets.
- IMPORTANT: Validate that the changes do not cause any new bugs, and that the code follows React and TypeScript best practices. Review Source D and Source E.

**Constraints**
- Architecture: Next.js 14 + React 18
- Code Language: "strict" TypeScript
- Package manager: Yarn
- Components: Do not use any outside components for existing libraries. Use the components in Source A or provide new components if required.
- IMPORTANT: Follow React and TypeScript best practices. Review Source D and Source E. No unsafe patterns or superfluous effects.
- Testing: Provide a verifiable test that our QA team can perform.

**Deliverables**
Provide the following in this order and specified format:
1. Analysis (400 words or fewer):
  - Root cause of the issue.
  - Why the current implementation fails with examples from the sources provided.

2. **Revised Code**
 - Provide complete revised code in separate code blocks for ease of copy/paste.
 - Ensure that the user experience and functional needs are preserved and that no new issues are created.

3. **Verification**
  - Steps we can run locally to confirm the bug has been fixed.

**Success Criteria**
- Resolution of the issue with verifiable solution that can be reproduced and tested.
- No state updates on unmounted components.
- No console warnings.
- The prior behavior is preserved, and there is no regression.
- Code follows React and TypeScript patterns and best practices.
