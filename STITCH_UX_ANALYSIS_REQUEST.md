## Current Pages & Features

### 1. **Homepage - Projects Showcase** (`/`)
**Function:** Gallery of 10+ featured projects with filtering and search

**Current User Flow:**
```
Land on page → View grid of project cards → Filter by category (All/AI/Web3/Data Viz/UI Systems)
→ Search by text → Click card → Modal opens with full project details, screenshots, tags
→ Access live demo or GitHub links
```

**Current UX Patterns:**
- Grid layout (responsive: 1/2/3 columns based on screen size)
- Category tabs for filtering
- Search input for text filtering
- Project cards with: title, description, preview image, tags
- Modal gallery view with multiple screenshots
- Links to live demos, GitHub repos, and videos

**Pain Points & Opportunities:**
- Users may not immediately understand what each project does from card view
- Category filtering could be more prominent or visual
- No way to save/bookmark favorite projects
- Modal gallery could support keyboard navigation
- No indication of project complexity or time investment to explore

---

### 2. **AI Chat Assistant** (`/ai-chat-assistant`)
**Function:** Real-time AI chat powered by OpenAI GPT-4o with persistent message history

**Current User Flow:**
```
Land on page → View chat interface → Type message in input → Press Enter/Send
→ Message appears in chat history → AI response streams in → Can copy response,
give feedback (thumbs up/down), or clear chat history
```

**Current UX Patterns:**
- Clean chat interface with user messages (right-aligned) and AI messages (left-aligned)
- Markdown rendering with syntax highlighting for code blocks
- Copy-to-clipboard button for AI responses
- Feedback mechanism (thumbs up/down) for each response
- Configurable send behavior: Enter vs. Ctrl+Enter toggle
- Clear chat button to reset conversation
- Message persistence via localStorage (survives page refresh)
- Loading state during API call (disabled input)

**Pain Points & Opportunities:**
- No chat history sidebar to revisit past conversations
- No ability to edit previous messages
- No suggested prompts or examples for first-time users
- Feedback mechanism exists but user doesn't see what happens after feedback
- No way to share interesting conversations
- Could benefit from typing indicators or partial streaming responses
- No context about AI capabilities/limitations shown upfront

---

### 3. **Multi-Agent Research System** (`/ai-multi-agent`)
**Function:** Three specialized AI agents collaborate sequentially (Researcher → Writer → Reviewer) to produce comprehensive research

**Current User Flow:**
```
Enter research topic → Submit → Watch active agent visualization (shows which agent is working)
→ Wait for completion (~30-60 seconds) → View results in three tabs:
Research findings, Content draft, Reviewer feedback
```

**Current UX Patterns:**
- Simple topic input form
- Visual agent status indicator (shows active agent during processing)
- Loading state with agent animations
- Results displayed in tabs (Research / Content / Review)
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Reset button to start new research

**Pain Points & Opportunities:**
- No progress indication beyond "which agent is active"
- Users can't see intermediate results as agents work
- No way to save or export research results
- Can't adjust agent parameters (thoroughness, focus areas)
- No history of past research topics
- Results formatting could be more structured/scannable
- No indication of how long the process typically takes
- Can't interrupt or refine mid-process

---

### 4. **GitHub Commits Analytics** (`/commits`)
**Function:** Interactive D3.js visualizations of commit history with filtering and CSV export

**Current User Flow:**
```
Land on page → View default commit chart → Filter by: Project dropdown, Group by
(day/week/month/year), Search text → Chart morphs with smooth transitions
→ Optionally export to CSV → Filters persist in URL for sharing
```

**Current UX Patterns:**
- Morphing D3.js chart (smooth transitions between states)
- Three filter controls: Project selector, Group by dropdown, Search input
- CSV export button
- URL persistence (filters saved in query parameters)
- Responsive chart resizing
- Hover tooltips showing commit details

**Pain Points & Opportunities:**
- Filter controls could be more visually organized
- No date range picker (relies on grouping only)
- Chart legend could be clearer
- No ability to compare multiple projects side-by-side
- Export filename is generic, not descriptive
- No onboarding for first-time users (what do the colors mean?)
- Could benefit from preset views (e.g., "Last 30 days", "This year")

---

### 5. **Web3 Wallet Connection** (`/wallet`)
**Function:** Connect crypto wallets (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.) and view account info

**Current User Flow:**
```
Land on page → Click "Connect Wallet" → Select connector (MetaMask/WalletConnect/etc.)
→ Approve in wallet → View: Address (with copy button), Balance, Network
→ Optionally switch chains → Disconnect when done
```

**Current UX Patterns:**
- Multiple wallet connector options
- Account display: formatted address, ETH balance, current network
- Copy address button
- Chain switcher dropdown (Ethereum, Sepolia, Polygon)
- Disconnect button
- Loading states during connection
- Error messages for failed connections

**Pain Points & Opportunities:**
- No explanation of why to connect wallet (what can you do after?)
- Connector options could have icons/branding
- No transaction history view
- Balance only shows ETH, not tokens
- Chain switching could be more prominent/intuitive
- No "sign message" or other wallet interaction demos
- Could explain what each network is for (Mainnet vs Testnets)

---

### 6. **LLM Data Visualizer** (`/ai-llm-data-visualizer`)
**Function:** Convert natural language prompts into interactive charts via OpenAI

**Current UX Patterns:**
- Embedded iframe from external Vercel app
- Natural language input → Data parsing → Chart generation
- Workflow: Prompt → AI cleaning → Interactive D3.js visualization

**Pain Points & Opportunities:**
- Embedded in iframe (limited integration with main site)
- Users may not understand the capabilities without examples
- No sample prompts or guided tutorial
- Can't easily save or share generated visualizations
- Limited error feedback if prompt is unclear

---

### 7. **AI Prompt Workbench** (`/ai-prompt`)
**Function:** Experimental tool for prompt engineering with modular panels

**Current UX Patterns:**
- Panel/Modal system
- File source integration
- Internal testing tool

**Pain Points & Opportunities:**
- Purpose may not be clear to visitors
- Could be more polished if intended for showcase
- Or could be hidden if purely internal tool

---

### 8. **Contact & Scheduling** (`/contact`)
**Function:** Calendly booking widget + contact form submission

**Current User Flow:**
```
Land on page → View Calendly embedded widget → Book time slot
OR → Fill contact form (name, email, message) → Submit → See success/error message
```

**Current UX Patterns:**
- Embedded Calendly widget for scheduling
- Contact form with Formspree backend
- Honeypot spam protection
- Success/error feedback messages
- Responsive layout

**Pain Points & Opportunities:**
- Contact form and calendar compete for attention (unclear which to use)
- No guidance on when to use form vs. calendar
- Form success message could be more engaging
- No indication of typical response time
- Could offer LinkedIn/Twitter as alternative contact methods
- Form validation could be more helpful (real-time feedback)

---

### 9. **About Page** (`/about`)
**Function:** Professional bio and experience summary

**Current UX Patterns:**
- Text-based biography
- Professional experience highlights
- Skills and expertise overview

**Pain Points & Opportunities:**
- Could be more visually engaging (timeline, icons, etc.)
- No clear call-to-action after reading
- Resume download could be more prominent
- Could link to specific projects mentioned in bio

---

## Current Design System

### Color Palette

- Verify claimed skills match projects
- Get sense of work quality and thinking process
- Find contact info easily

**Challenges:**
- Projects don't clearly map to job requirements
- No easy way to filter by specific technologies
- AI features are cool but may not demonstrate business value
- Resume/credentials not immediately accessible

---

### Journey 3: Exploring AI Capabilities

```

**Goals:**
- Assess code quality and architecture choices
- See innovative solutions or unique approaches
- Determine if worth following/contacting for collaboration

**Challenges:**
- GitHub links are secondary (modal click required)
- No technical deep-dives or architecture explanations
- Commit analytics is interesting but disconnected from projects
- No blog or articles demonstrating thought leadership
